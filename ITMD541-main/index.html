		<h3 class="para">Hi! my name is Rahul Poojari, I'm from Mumbai, India and currently pursuing a master's degree in ITM with concentration in Data Analytics and Management here at IIT. I have gained experience in writing basic html pages with css during my undergraduate studies. I have never used JavaScript in any of the web pages I have designed before and I'm excited to learn using Js in this ITMD541 course.
